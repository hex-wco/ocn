      <h1>On Mark News Network</h1>
    <h2>9-27-2019</h2>
<br>
The network that we know as today was called OMNN when it first begun, it was created exactly on the founder’s birthday, the founder was called Xaria and his goal was to make the best network in the game, the most followed, the most viewed and the most active.
<br><br>
The news network started off unique, the journalism style consisted of poetry, every news post always had a poem in them, it gave a kick to the breaking news and it turned out successful due to readers’ curiosity and love to the poems.
<br><br><br>
<h1>Rise of OMNN</h1>
<h2>1/1/2021</h2>
After 1/2 years of continuous journalism and implementations the network was still a bit small but its growth was increasing rapidly, months would go by and eventually more love would be given to the network after the founder posted the first ever OMNN post in the forums, it included a poem to the top 40 alliances in the game, <a href="https://forum.politicsandwar.com/index.php?/topic/30668-a-poem-for-the-top-40-alliances/#comment-484569">click here</a> to be redirected to the forum post.
<br><br>
More and more members were being invited to OMNN, giveaways were being hosted and finally shows began being hosted as well, OMNN was moving too quick and rising too fast which meant the name and its specialty were childish, the founder decided to finally move on and push the network beyond its limits.

<h1>Orbis Crowned News</h1>
<h2>10/5/2021</h2>
<br>
OMNN was rebranded to the infamous OCN, goodbye poetry, welcome regularity.
It was a great move, it increased the employment-rate because the staff didn’t have to deal with writing a poem so OCN started getting more active than usual at that point, but the founder began to go off course, he was pushing it too far...
<br><br>
<h1>The Dark Age</h1>
<h2>15/5/2021</h2>
    <br>
Xaria made many implementations that raised eyebrows, adding an economy system with a virtual ocn coin that can be used to buy things on a shop, added bot-channels, an event category and many more channels that would be labeled as dead, nobody used the implementation and soon enough OCN started fading away, inactivity struck and the staff team was slowly getting empty & inactive.
<br><br>
From this point, OCN was going active then back inactive, it was experiencing declines here and there, it wasn’t consistent but the founder tried, the dark age period would be a curse, popping up in OCN from month to month.
<br><br>
<h1>The Golden Age</h1>
<h2>1/9/2021</h2>
<br>
The founder decided to remove most of the implementations he has added, straying back to the right path, voice chatting and talking to the readers twice as much, increasing payroll and improving the channels-setup.
<br><br>
OCN’s setup was great, it wasn’t cluttered anymore but it wouldn’t work without staff, so new staff were added and a voice show as well that would carry OCN’s activity. it was moving again and it was moving quick, the server had 600 members. Everything seemed to be going great.
    <br><br>
    <h1>The Dark Awakening</h1>
<h2>12/12/2021-1/1/2022</h2>
<br>
Unfortunately to OCN’s luck, just when the network was going well it ended up getting nuked in the morning by a an Administrator called “Merky Mo”, everybody was banned from the server and  doubtful rumours say a competitive network was behind it.
<br><br>
OCN wasn’t the only network that was nuked but a neighbouring network as well that goes by “Pirate Islands Times” (PIT). The same administrator also had permissions in PIT so he nuked that network as well.
<br><br>
It was a dark time and it was stressful but the founder managed to bring back 60% of the banned members into a new server. That stunt only awakened the two nuked networks, the activity was through the roof, the news reached everybody in the game which would make OCN rise faster than it did before, breaking its curse and finally it began slowly gaining a fanbase over upcoming years.
<br><br>
<h1>Present</h1>
<h2>1/1/2022-1/1/2023+</h2>
    <br>
From that/this point, nothing major is effecting OCN’s existence not even the competitive remaining networks out there, it was moving forward with new staff every few months, growing and becoming a community based network, rising steadily and finally reaching 1,000+ server readers, it’s no longer experiencing heavy declines as now OCN is in the big league, viewed/followed by many alliances and individuals in Politics and War.
